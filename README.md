ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Thiemo.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in collaboration on conversational interfaces, argumentation mining, empathy detection or AI-based adaptive learning tools. Recent punlications can be found at https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=4fsjAjoAAAAJ&hl=de

My research lies in the general area of Human-Computer Interaction with influences from Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. I strive to understand how humans perceive, interact, and learn with intelligent tools. Based on these insights, I build adaptive user interfaces that go beyond static and rule-based interaction to advance the capabilities when working and learning in the digital world.

Specifically, I am driven by the vast opportunities to enhance and improve pedagogical scenarios based on recent advantages in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to enable humans to learn self-reliant and individually independent of an educator or their background. To do so, I use techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI) to build AI-powered education tools. My research follows three connected main lines of work: 1) create and study pedagogical conversational agents or intelligent writing support systems to improve educational scenarios, 2) explore methods and techniques to model student performance in numerical or textual data, and 3) build computational approaches that control when, where and how to provide students intelligent feedback and self-evaluation.
